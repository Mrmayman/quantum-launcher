# v0.2
## Features
### Forge
- Added a Forge installer (and uninstaller too)
- Select your instance, go to `Mods` -> `Install Forge` and you're done!
- Note: Only release 1.6.4 and above are currently supported.
### Logs
- Now you can view game logs!
- When the game launches, the logs will be available on the right side.
- Press `Copy Logs` to copy the logs (if you face any issues you can send it)
- Only a section of the log is shown for performance reasons, but you can get the whole thing by pressing the `Copy Logs` button.
### Misc
- There is now an update detector that looks for launcher updates and asks you if you want to install it. If you accept, it will automatically update the launcher and create a backup for you.
- The UI design has been changed to be cleaner.
- Added a progress bar for Fabric installer.
- Added an uninstaller for Fabric.
- Now there are basic command line options: `--version` and `--help`. I am planning to add a headless command line mode in the future.
- Now the game's current directory will be the `.minecraft` folder. This fixes random files popping up near the launcher executable.
- Now the debug output of the launcher text incorporates colored text and dynamic progress bars.
