# v0.4.1
## Modding
- added Modpacks, Shaders and Resource Packs stores
- drag-and-drop support for mod files, modpacks and presets
- jarmod patching support (useful for old Minecraft versions)
- OptiFine support for b1.6.6, b1.7.3, 1.2.5 and 1.5.2
### UX
- "Open Mod Page" in mod description now shows URL in tooltip
- added bullet/numbered list support in curseforge mod descriptions
- mod update checking is now up to 3-4x faster!

## Portable Mode & Custom Paths
You can control where QuantumLauncher stores data by placing a `qldir.txt` file in one of the following locations:
- Next to the launcher executable
- In the working directory where it's run
- In the global [QuantumLauncher folder](https://mrmayman.github.io/quantumlauncher/faq#files-location)

Leave the file **blank** for full portable mode, or write a path inside it to set a custom data location.
> Note: On macOS you may need to **extract the `.app` from the DMG** for portable mode.

## Menu Overhauls
- Welcome screen redesigned to guide new users more clearly
- Error screen looks better, now has a "Copy Log + Error" button
- Fabric Install screen is now simpler and less cluttered
## UI/UX
- new Catppuccin color scheme
- improved aesthetics of light themes
- animated pulsating "..." dots in a few "Loading" screens
- minor tweaks to buttons and layout in many screens
- added a "Clean Java Installs" button (for reinstalling java) in launcher settings
- old versions in the version list now have cleaner names ("beta/b1.7/b1.7.3" -> "b1.7.3")
- window size now respects UI scale
## Keyboard Navigation
- Up/Down arrow keys to select instance
- Ctrl+Enter -> launch instance
- Ctrl+Backspace -> kill instance
- Ctrl+Q -> exit launcher (only in main menu, when nothing's running)
- (note: on macOS it's Cmd instead of Ctrl)
- More coming in the future!
## Game Crashed Message
- there is now a "Join Discord" button in Logs tab
- there's no longer a tip mentioning a "second terminal" upon crash (no longer needed)
## Dependencies
- replaced OpenSSL with rustls
- linux binary now only depends on `libgcc_s` and `libc` (glibc);
  OpenSSL and LZMA `.so` dependencies have been removed
## Fixes
- crash messages now appear in Logs tab (critical!)
- forge now works after renaming instance
- multiplayer now works in 1.16.x for offline accounts
- mod updating and preset importing are now working again! (fixed error for curseforge, index corruption for modrinth)
- fixed extreme launcher log file spam
### UI/UX
- UI scaling now has a minimum limit preventing unusable layouts
- many mod-related operations now return you to Mods screen, instead of launch screen
- pressing Esc in mod descriptions now exits the description only (not the entire store)
- fixed mod store "forgetting" scroll position when opening description and exiting
### Platform-specific
- fixed 1.13-1.16 crashing on linux ARM
- fixed 1.8.9 crashing on macOS ARM
- fixed Java 8 (1.16.5 and below) compatibility on Windows ARM and macOS
