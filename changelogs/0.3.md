# v0.3
TLDR; Mod manager, OptiFine support, mod store for downloading mods, performance improvements, bugfixes
## Mods
- Select, enable, disable and delete your mods with the new mod manager!
- Added OptiFine support! (Mods->Install OptiFine)
### Store
- Added a built-in mod store, integrated with modrinth.com (Mods->Download Mods)
- You can now search, view and download mods
- *note: this is experimental and may be buggy*
## Optimization
- *DRASTICALLY* improved download times for creating an instance
- Asset files are shared between instances, saving a lot of storage
## Old Minecraft
- Fixed sound being broken in old versions (1.6.4 and below) due to incorrect asset downloading
- Betacraft proxy is now used for older versions, resulting in correct sounds and skins

- The launcher settings menu contains links to our GitHub, website and discord.
- You can now edit Java and Game arguments in instance settings.
- Added a debugging option to disable log output (to see advanced crash messages correctly in the terminal window). Use this if your instance crashed without any logs. Edit Instance -> Enable logging (disable it)
## Command-Line
- `--command` argument to not make it pop up a window (headless)
- `--list-instances` flag to print a list of instances (name, version, loader)
